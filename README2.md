The tile grid map builds on [this map](https://bl.ocks.org/officeofjane/d33d6ef783993b60b15a3fe0f8da1481) by Jane Pong.

This website uses the following javascript libraries:

- [d3.js](https://d3js.org/) (for graphing)
- [vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (for interactivity)
- [d3.geo2rect](https://github.com/sebastian-meier/d3.geo2rect) (for morphing map into tile grid)
